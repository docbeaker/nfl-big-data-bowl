# nfl-big-data-bowl

This contains analysis code for a submission to the NFL Big Data Bowl 2024 on Kaggle. 
The submission notebook can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/carrot1500/evaluating-tackle-difficulty), 
though I initially developed the notebook locally, and a copy of that can be found in
[my notebooks repo](https://github.com/docbeaker/notebooks/blob/main/nfl-big-data/TrackingData.ipynb).
